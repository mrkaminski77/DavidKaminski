## About me
Currently employed as Reporting Analyst for Serco Citizen Services, this role required me to re-engineer the reporting solution end to end; developing the scripts to transform and load the incoming data, normalise and store the data on SQL Server, and develop the Excel applications providing finished reports to end users. Currently working on a documentation framework to automate production of documentation for the solution.

I am a classic INTP personality type. A strong analytical thinker who learnt to program an Apple IIe at age eleven. My programming skills allow me to automate workflows within the businesses I work for, and I have always been a valued member of a team for these skills. In my spare time I like to practice guitar, enjoy vegetarian cooking, or enjoy a morning of sunshine at the markets.

## My experience

### Reporting Analyst - _Serco Citizen Services_
* June 2014 - Current

    In my current role I am responsible for delivery of management intelligence and design and maintenance of the reporting solution. The initial platform didn't scale well and I have redeveloped the solution database along with the ETL process in order to make the data usable.

### Business Operations Manager - _Talk Ezy Group_
* December 2010 - May 2014

    I began with Talk Ezy Group as a B2B sales consultant, selling mobile telephony solutions to key corporate accounts. During this time I developed advanced tools for analyzing the mobile telephony bill and modelling the best combination of plans. These tools really gave our business a competitive advantage in the market and I developed strong product knowledge for the Telstra Enterprise and Government solutions. Eventually I became the Operations Manager and left this business due to redundancy in 2014.

### Business Sales Consultant - _Telstra Enterprise and Government_
* October 2007 - November 2009

    After my redundancy from Telstra Service Edge I was re-employed by Telstra Enterprise and Government as a contractor, to assist with the TE&G CDMA migration team. Initially a six month contract, this was extended a number of times until November 2009 when I left the organisation to work with Telstra Business Dealers.


### Wireless Data Customer Support - _Telstra Service Edge_
* July 2005 - September 2007

    Telstra WDCS (Wireless Data Customer Support) was a second level helpdesk dedicated to assisting Enterprise and Corporate customers with devices like Blackberry and ActiveSync. After our initial recruitment I quickly became an SME and developed support application for the other consultants that I called WiDiCuS. The web page was used extensively within our team. In 2009 the entire team was made redundant as part of Telstra effort to streamline their Service Edge division. I was one of two consultants seconded to Townsville for eight weeks to re-train consultants in a larger center.


### Insurance Consultant - _Insurance Australia Group_
* 1999 - November 2004

    During my time with IAG as Insurance Consultant I developed a critical piece of automation for the business. One of our requirements was production of insurance certificates for finance purposes, and to begin with this was a manual process involving consultants hand writing a form and physically going to a fax machine.  
    Using my knowledge of the HUON mainframe and the macros provided by the SNA client I was able to automate production of Insurance Certificates using Microsoft Word and a Fax gateway. This was the first time software that I developed found a place within an industry and the last time I heard they were still using it.
